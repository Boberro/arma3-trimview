About:
-----
I'm one of those people that can't play Arma with short view distance. It's all nice and dandy until you fight in Kavala or Tanoa's jungle, and your framerate drops because of least useful graphical feature at the moment. This is why I created this addon - to allow you (and me) to trim view distance temporarily, with just a press of a button, just for the time of critical framerate need (trim mode).
Additionaly, you can use it the other way around - temporary change your setting to higher value than normal, if you really need to see that tank in a distance (focus mode).


Installation:
------------
As always, copy mod directory (@bbrr_trimview) to your main game directory.

How to use:
----------
    Trim - Ctrl+End
    Focus - Ctrl+Home

Press once to enable, press again to return to normal.
You can change the default binding going to Options -> Controls -> Configure addons (bottom of the screen) and selecting TrimView from the drop-down list.

By default view distance is trimmed to 200 meters, and lengthened to 2000. You can change the settings by going to Options -> Game -> Configure addons (bottom of a screen) and selecting TrimView from the drop-down list.
