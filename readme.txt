Boberro's TrimView
v1.0

Acknowledgement:
This mod is inspired by, and based on "Cyprus Push-to-Hear". Give it some love at https://forums.bistudio.com/topic/173635-cyprus-push-tohear/


About:
I'm one of those people that can't play Arma with short view distance. It's all nice and dandy until you fight in Kavala or Tanoa's jungle, and your framerate drops because of least useful graphical feature at the moment. This is why I created this addon - to allow you (and me) to trim view distance temporarily, with just a press of a button, just for the time of critical framerate need.

Additionaly, you can use it the other way around - temporary change your setting to higher value than normal, if you really need to see that tank in a distance.


Installation:
As always, copy mod directory (@bbrr_trimview) to your main game directory, then copy "userconfig" that you'll find inside it into the main game directory as well. It'll ask you if you want to merge userconfig with existing folder - you do.


How to use:
Default key binding is Left Ctrl + End. Press it once to trim view distance (an icon will show), press again to return to normal.
You can change the default binding going to Options -> Controls -> Configure addons (bottom of the screen) and selecting Boberro's TrimView from the drop-down list.

By default view distance is trimmed to 200 meters, but you can change it in userconfig file (userconfig/bbrr_trimview/bbrr_trimview_config.hpp)


Changelog (probably does not interest you, but I'm old and can forget stuff otherwise):
v1.0.2 - added ability to squint, in addition to shortening the view distance; out with the userconfig, all hail the CBA!
v1.0.1 - experimental ability to lengthen the view distance instead of shortening it
v1.0 - initial release
